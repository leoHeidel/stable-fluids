# stable-fluids

this is a school project for the class INF574 at Polytechnique Paris. The goal of this project is to have an implementation of the artivle *Stable Fluids* by **Jos Stam** (1999).

For this project we use python 3 and Tensorflow 2.0. This may not be the most logical choice, but is a good exercise. A better choice would be to use openGL.
